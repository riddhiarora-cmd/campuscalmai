# Calm Mind AI

## Project Overview
Calm Mind AI is an AI-powered emotional support companion designed for young adults.
It is not therapy, not diagnosis, and not a replacement for professional help.

## Recent Improvements (Today)
- Added a structured system prompt defining emotional intent, ethics, and boundaries
- Clarified that the app prioritizes emotional regulation and reflection over advice
- Designed conversation behavior to adapt to user energy and stress type
- Introduced non-verbal regulation concepts such as a “Just Breathe” mode

These improvements focus on making the AI feel safer, calmer, and more intentional.
